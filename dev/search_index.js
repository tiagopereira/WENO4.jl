Based on https://github.com/Goobley/Weno4Interpolation by Chris Osborne.\n\nArguments\n\nxs::AbstractVector{<:Number}: The x-coordinates at which to evaluate the interpolated values\nxp::AbstractVector{<:Number}: The x-coordinates of the data points. Must have at least four elements, be increasing, and have no NaNs.\nfp::AbstractVector{<:Number}: The y-coordinates of the data points. Must have same length as xp.\n\nKeywords\n\nextrapolate::Bool: whether or not to use extrapolation. If true, will perform quadratic extrapolation from the edge points. When false, it will not throw an error if xs is outside xp, but return the closest fp value.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#WENO4.weno4_q-NTuple{9, Any}","page":"Home","title":"WENO4.weno4_q","text":"Compute the q2 and q3 Lagrange interpolation factors for 4th order WENO interpolation.
